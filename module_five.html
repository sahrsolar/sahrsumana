	Reflection: Software Engineering Project Management 	</p>

WHAT:
Over the past twelve weeks, I've been studying the Software Engineering Project Management module, and it's been a very enjoyable experience. With my 8 years’ experience working in project management, some of the initial topics we covered were comfortably within familiar territory for me. Yet, as the module progressed, learning more about the distinct differences between traditional project management and that specific to software engineering, brought to light new information and a refreshing perspective. Reflecting on my journey throughout this module, I've come to realise the fundamental complexity of managing software engineering projects. My background has provided me with a good foundation in the basic principles of project management. However, diving deeper into the specifics, focusing particularly on software project management, and exploring methodologies like Waterfall vs Agile, the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), and analysing ‘why projects can fail’, has been an educational experience. It has significantly expanded my understanding and has given me a comprehensive knowledge base to take forward into my professional career. The topic of projects failing was particularly interesting, especially given my own experience in a professional setting where a software development project failed due to miscommunicated requirements from the business side. It was really useful to delve into this topic in an academic setting, away from the pressures of work, to fully understand and grasp how I can contribute effectively to avoid repeating past mistakes.
	</p>

<p>
SO WHAT:
Participating in this module has brought up a mixed range of feelings. Initially, there was a strong sense of familiarity and confidence, coming from my career experience. However, being introduced to new frameworks and methodologies soon brought a new blend of challenge and excitement. My key learning from this course is the critical importance of continuous improvement in software project management. This learning isn't just theoretical but has significant practical implications. For instance, in our group activities, I was able to apply these new methodologies to enhance our team's coordination, particularly as we were working remotely. We started by dividing the tasks among us, but it quickly became apparent that this approach was not optimal. This experience has taught me the immense value of being open to new approaches and that it is always essential to evolve continuously as the project progresses. I've also learned that clear communication is absolutely vital. For example, when we were about to submit our final assignment, there was a miscommunication regarding one of the tasks, which was a critical learning point. I have learned that as projects progresses and things get busy, don’t forget the basics that ensure the project can be a success. 
</p>

<p>
NOW WHAT:
My contribution to the group project focused on leveraging my strengths as a business analyst and project manager. I took the lead in several of our weekly team meetings, actively engaging in discussions, taking detailed notes and recording them on our confluence, and playing a key role in decision-making. I ensured that my tasks were completed to a high standard and that I was an active, contributing member of the team. I initiated the setup of a confluence space to facilitate our collaboration and to monitor our progress. My responsibilities also included working on our Gherkin scenarios, formulating the business requirements, compiling our PowerPoint presentation, and putting together a business-ready proposal document. As a team, we collaborated effectively. Everyone was very flexible in organising team meetings, we shared the workload equally, and maintained consistent communication outside of our meetings, using WhatsApp. 
Reflecting on the module, I've gained a deeper understanding that managing software projects is not just about individual expertise. It's fundamentally about excellent teamwork, clear communication, and the adaptability to continuously modify our approach to meet the specific challenges of delivering high-quality, well-tested software.
